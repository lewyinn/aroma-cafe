# Aroma Café Website

Welcome to the Aroma Café website, a modern and stylish Next.js application showcasing a bold, artisanal coffee shop experience. Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, this project delivers a sleek, dark-themed interface with a focus on artisan coffee, creative ambiance, and a vibrant user experience. Deployed on Vercel, the Aroma Café website is optimized for performance and SEO.

## Features

- **Modern Design**: A dark-mode UI with bold typography (Plus Jakarta Sans) and dynamic animations for a unique, non-generic coffee shop vibe.
- **SEO Optimized**: Comprehensive metadata for search engine indexing and social sharing, tailored for Aroma Café.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully responsive design for seamless experiences on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Fast Performance**: Leverages Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, ensuring quick load times.
- **Vercel Deployment**: Easy deployment with Vercel for scalability and reliability.

## Getting Started

To run the Aroma Café website locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lewyinn/aromacafe.git
   cd aromacafe
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

5. Start editing the page by modifying `app/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project Structure

- **`/src/app`**: Contains the main application files, including `page.jsx` (home page) and `layout.jsx` (root layout with metadata).
- **`/public`**: Static assets like `favicon.ico`, and images (e.g., `/assets/Cozy-Cafe.webp`).
- **`src/components`**: Reusable `React components` (e.g., `navigation, hero section`) for modular UI development..
- **Font Optimization**: Uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to load Plus Jakarta Sans for a modern, clean typography.
